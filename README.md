## About the Repo
This is the github repository for Scope USC's website. Which can be found [here](http://scopeusc.com).
The website uses [paper-kit-2](https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-kit-2-pro/index.html). Grab components from there to adhere to the general style.
The old website (before June 6th, 2018) is located [here](http://scopeusc.com/legacy)

## About Scope

### Build and learn cool things with great people.

That's the motto that Scope was founded and built on. As a member you will build projects as part of an exciting curriculum that hones and improves your coding skills. Best of all, members join the tight-knit Scope family and get to partake in awesome community events throughout the semester.

At Scope, we also host retreats, industry speakers, hackathons, and more to encourage an inclusive culture of creation, hacking, and fun at USC.
