                <h2>A Note From the Board</h2>
                <p>Scope is a USC computer science club founded on one main idea: to build and learn cool things with great people. We are working to create a community of bright computer science students that want to learn and prepare themselves for careers as engineers.</p>
                <p>We put students through a different curriculum each semester where they learn a new framework, topic, or language by building a project. These curriculums vary from topics like iOS development to designing software that implements AI. By working in teams, students develop friendships and join a community of builders at USC.</p>
                <p>We believe in inclusivity and openness. That's why all projects that students build are open-source and hosted on public GitHub repositories.</p>
                <p>We also host retreats, industry speakers, hackathons, and more to encourage an inclusive culture of creation, hacking, and fun at USC.</p>
                <p>Scope offers a direct path to getting in touch with bright and motivated computer science students at USC. We offer four sponsorship tiers that allow your organization a variety of ways to get involved annually. These plans are flexible. Please get in touch if you would like more information or to discuss specific ways we can help your organization.</p>
                <p>Check out the plans below and contact us by email: pareto at usc dot edu.</p>
                <p>We truly appreciate any and all support from you.</p>
                <p>Thanks so much,</p>
